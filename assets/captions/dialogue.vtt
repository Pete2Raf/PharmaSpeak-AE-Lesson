Speaker 1: Good morning. I’d like to report an adverse event from one of my doctors.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Speaker 2: Sure, please go ahead. What happened?

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
Speaker 1: The patient developed a mild skin rash two days after starting the new batch of Amoxiril 500 mg. The doctor stopped the medication, and the rash cleared within 48 hours.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Do you have the patient’s initials, age, and gender?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Speaker 1: Yes, it’s M.A., a 45-year-old male. The doctor didn’t report any other reactions.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Speaker 2: Perfect. Please send me the completed adverse event form today so we can log it in the system.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Speaker 1: Will do. I’ll email it to you right after this call.
